Hi there 

I'm a Data Analyst passionate about uncovering meaningful insights that drive smarter decisions and empower communities.

I thrive at the intersection of data, problem-solving, and impact. With a blend of technical expertise and curiosity, I turn raw data into stories that spark action, whether it's driving business growth or helping solve social challenges. 

My journey continues through explorations in **Data Science**, **AI**, and **Data Engineering**, all aimed at amplifying the power of data for social good.

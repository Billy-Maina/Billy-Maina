Hi there 

I'm a Data Analyst passionate about uncovering actionable insights that drive smarter business decisions.

I excel at the intersection of data, problem-solving, and impact. By combining technical expertise with storytelling, I transform raw data into clear narratives and visual insights that engage, explain, and enlighten stakeholders, driving informed decisions, meaningful change, and measurable impact.

I build intuitive dashboards and analytical solutions to help stakeholders visualize patterns and understand performance at a glance for informed decision-making.

My journey continues through explorations in **Data Science**, **AI**, and **Data Engineering**, all aimed at amplifying the power of data for social good.
